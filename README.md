Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m Saagnik, an AI/ML enthusiast passionate about building and exploring intelligent systems.

I learn, design, and build whatever sparks my curiosity in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll experiment with it, train a model, and try to turn it into a working project.
My primary tech stack includes Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas.

I’m currently focused on deep learning, practical ML applications, and building strong fundamentals through hands-on projects. These projects reflect my growing understanding of algorithms, data pipelines, and real-world problem solving.

Fun Facts:
I’m deeply interested in AI & emerging technologies
I enjoy mixing technology with creativity
I prefer learning by building
Hobbies: coding, AI experiments, design, exploring new tools
